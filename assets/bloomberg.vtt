1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300
And amid love though in San Francisco, this is Bloomberg Technology.

2
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:08.400
Coming up, it has been the year for NVIDIA, AI stocks and lofty valuations.

3
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.680
Meanwhile, the Nasdaq 100 index is set for its best year in over a decade.

4
00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:14.700
Can tech continue its golden era going into 2024?

5
00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.870
Plus, it's a must for Musk. A San Francisco federal judge

6
00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:25.070
has signaled that Elon Musk must testify in the SEC Twitter stock probe.

7
00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:26.110
We're going to have all the details.

8
00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:30.370
And the outlook for electric vehicles isn't quite as bright as it was six months ago.

9
00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:32.350
And the U.S. might be to blame.

10
00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:37.090
We talk about how GM, Ford and Tesla contribute to the EV sales setback.

11
00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:39.030
But first, let's check in on these markets.

12
00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.910
And we still digest the days after the Federal Reserve

13
00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:44.970
and the view on where interest rates are going to be going.

14
00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:48.310
Look, some talk coming perhaps Fed, New York Fed,

15
00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:51.490
Williams putting a little bit of a damper on some of the exuberance that we've been

16
00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:54.270
seeing in terms of the direction of travel for interest rates as soon as March.

17
00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.650
Nevertheless, though, Nasdaq manages to power on up.

18
00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:57.710
We're up by five tenths percent.

19
00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.790
The 10-year yield's holding steady, but we did dive below that four percent number.

20
00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:05.910
So clearly, there is still that view that interest rates are coming in

21
00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:08.550
to the lower side of things continuing into 2024.

22
00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:10.030
I'm looking at the Bloomberg dollar index, though,

23
00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.930
just pushing up on some of the lows that we've seen in the last few days.

24
00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.350
We're currently up a quarter of a percent.

25
00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.870
What does that mean for crypto when you're looking at U.S. dollar versus Bitcoin, for example?

26
00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:21.370
Well, after the last few days, we've seen quite a topsy-turvy ride.

27
00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:25.430
We have seen the highest highs of some almost $44,000, almost $45,000.

28
00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:28.910
We're now back down to a $41,823 is where we currently trade.

29
00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:31.070
So a little bit of money coming off the table, Ed,

30
00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:32.750
after we powered up in the world of crypto.

31
00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:33.630
What have you got on the micro?

32
00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:37.790
So we're going to have a big focus in this show today on electric vehicles

33
00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:40.570
and the outlook for next year because it's changing.

34
00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:42.270
This is Friday session.

35
00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.890
Tesla's higher half a percentage point.

36
00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.090
The other name's in the red.

37
00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.270
GM is cutting 1,300 workers across two factories in Michigan.

38
00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.630
But what all of these stocks have in common,

39
00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.470
well, the top three at least, is that they're all on track

40
00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.230
for six straight weeks of weekly gains.

41
00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:01.950
In GM's case, that's the best run of weekly gains going back to December 2014.

42
00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.510
I bring that up because there's been so much negative news.

43
00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:08.170
All the data about revised outlooks for next year.

44
00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:11.250
Cruise, the autonomous driving unit of GM being in trouble.

45
00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:16.550
Tesla's autopilot probe and the soft recall and software update this week.

46
00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:20.130
But if you extrapolate out, these EV stocks have been on a tear

47
00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.230
at the same time as the S&P 500 and NASDAQ 100

48
00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.490
are on their longest and best streaks in a decade.

49
00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:26.850
Then there's NVIDIA.

50
00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.710
I think NVIDIA is still the big focus for this market.

51
00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:32.650
The gain is more than 230% year to date.

52
00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:36.910
The news in Friday session was a block trade of more than a billion dollars

53
00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:39.630
on the stock that traded at a pretty lofty level.

54
00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.630
Seems to be having an impact on the market.

55
00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:45.470
But again, 236% gain year to date.

56
00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.870
It has been a big contributing factor to the rally that we've seen

57
00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.290
in the NASDAQ 100 and the S&P 500.

58
00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:53.810
And the question is, well, what happens

59
00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.430
if NVIDIA just stops and its momentum halts?

60
00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.490
Could it?

61
00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:58.130
Would it?

62
00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.790
Should it?

63
00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:00.430
Nancy Curtin is the person to be asking.

64
00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.250
Global CIO of Altai Tiedemann Global.

65
00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:05.330
A lot of money under management.

66
00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:08.870
A lot of working through what has been decades of

67
00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:11.390
whether we see money and exuberance into tech or not.

68
00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:16.950
From your perspective, are the valuations of a name like NVIDIA rational at this moment?

69
00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:20.210
Look, Caroline, they certainly discount a lot.

70
00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:21.030
That's for sure.

71
00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.590
At more than 30 times earnings on average.

72
00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:27.970
And I think one of the things we're seeing now is competition to NVIDIA.

73
00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:31.710
You know, when a company has an 85% monopoly,

74
00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:35.790
saw their profits go up seven times in a year

75
00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:39.230
and is facing a trillion dollar market opportunity,

76
00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:41.050
we should expect competition.

77
00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:46.890
And so far, I think when we look at what Intel and AMD have brought to the table

78
00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:49.770
from a hardware perspective, it looks pleasing.

79
00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:53.870
But NVIDIA has quite a competitive note in terms of CUDA,

80
00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:56.350
software developer tools, et cetera.

81
00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:00.030
So, you know, there is a lot to go for in Gen AI.

82
00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:07.310
And don't be so quick to put down these valuations.

83
00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:12.190
Nancy, we have covered that competition so deeply on the program in the last two weeks,

84
00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:14.510
starting with AMD's MI300X.

85
00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:16.150
I was there on the ground with Lisa Su.

86
00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:20.010
24 hours ago, you had Intel talking about Gaudi 3.

87
00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:22.150
What is the investment strategy?

88
00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.110
Do you just pick one of those names, go with it,

89
00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:27.050
or do you need to have all three in the portfolio?

90
00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:30.310
Look, I think you're going to have to see how this evolves.

91
00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:33.990
Remember, neither of these chips are available at the moment.

92
00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:39.510
So if you're a company building a Gen AI application, it's still H100.

93
00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:41.350
It's still the NVIDIA chip.

94
00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:44.670
And by the way, NVIDIA is not going to stand still here.

95
00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:47.670
You know, they've got things on the horizon,

96
00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:52.630
a very aggressive product launch as we head into 24 and 25,

97
00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:56.030
you know, B100, aka Blackwell.

98
00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:00.130
So, you know, let's not write off the NVIDIA advantage.

99
00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:04.690
But as I said, their software ecosystem, CUDA in particular,

100
00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:07.750
is super powerful for NVIDIA.

101
00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:10.870
Moving away from perhaps the picks and the shovels, the chips,

102
00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:12.830
to actually who are building the models,

103
00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:14.870
who's applying the models most efficiently,

104
00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:17.530
it's been all about Microsoft to a certain degree.

105
00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:19.610
And starting to be Alphabet,

106
00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:22.810
do you think that we need to broaden our perspective there as well?

107
00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:25.350
How we're starting to see generative AI impact the business models?

108
00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:29.230
Do you know, I think there was a lot of criticism of Gemini,

109
00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:32.050
which of course was Google's launch around two weeks ago,

110
00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:34.210
around latency issues, et cetera.

111
00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:35.670
Okay, put that aside.

112
00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:36.970
I think it misses the point.

113
00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:40.170
What we saw with Google was multimodal.

114
00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:42.590
I mean, that interaction had inference.

115
00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:43.350
It had text.

116
00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:43.970
It had image.

117
00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:45.690
It had translation.

118
00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:47.530
It had coding all at once.

119
00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:51.170
So I think it gives you a future image of where this gen AI is going.

120
00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:54.550
As you watch that silly thing with the guitar and the duck,

121
00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:56.010
do see it if you haven't seen it.

122
00:05:56.170 --> 00:06:00.050
You need to think about the applications in financial services,

123
00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:02.910
in healthcare, in the industrial sector.

124
00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:04.570
This is absolutely huge.

125
00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:07.330
And I reckon as I was watching it, Caroline,

126
00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:10.570
that maybe 26, 27, maybe 28,

127
00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:13.890
we're going to look at the mouse, the keyboard.

128
00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:14.490
I don't know.

129
00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:15.410
What are those things?

130
00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:18.270
Like ancient history, prehistoric stuff, right?

131
00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:20.790
Because you're going to be able to interact with the computer

132
00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:22.550
in a completely different way.

133
00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:24.750
And the coding language is going to be English.

134
00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:26.810
So lots of interesting implications.

135
00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:29.990
Nancy, we're thoroughly enjoying this conversation.

136
00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:31.370
One of the things I'm so interested about you

137
00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:32.630
is earlier in your career,

138
00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:36.090
you ran venture capital desks, private equity desks.

139
00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:39.610
And I wonder if that changes your approach as a CIO.

140
00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:41.610
When you look across public equities,

141
00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:44.350
are you kind of conscious of what's happening upstream

142
00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:46.190
in some of the earlier stage companies

143
00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:49.650
who might benefit from what Caroline and I call

144
00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:50.910
the picks and shovels, right?

145
00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:54.090
The H100s underpinning the work in the R&D.

146
00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:55.890
You know, absolutely.

147
00:06:55.890 --> 00:07:00.030
So we have investments in both public and private markets.

148
00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:02.890
And on the private side, I want to share with you a snippet.

149
00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:04.830
One of our private equity managers,

150
00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:06.450
so now we're talking about buyout,

151
00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:09.630
reports that every single one of their companies

152
00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:12.230
is using Gen AI in some form.

153
00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:16.770
And they are seeing productivity enhancements of 30% to 40%.

154
00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:18.090
That's huge, OK?

155
00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:20.170
And that's in private equity buyout.

156
00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:22.450
And the venture side, our managers

157
00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:25.910
are reporting enormously interesting applications,

158
00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:30.450
disruptive business models, horizontal uses of Gen AI,

159
00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:32.070
vertical uses of Gen AI.

160
00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:35.310
So there is so much more to come here.

161
00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:38.030
We're aware of what's going on with the infrastructure layer,

162
00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:39.170
as you mentioned.

163
00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:42.190
But once we get past that 24 and into 25,

164
00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:46.370
expect a whole host of disruptive business models.

165
00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:49.030
And more importantly, business applications.

166
00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:50.690
We're going to go to work, and this

167
00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:53.110
will be embedded in business processes.

168
00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:56.710
And we're still early in that journey so far this year.

169
00:07:56.710 --> 00:08:00.810
So boy, when you're thinking about allocating,

170
00:08:00.810 --> 00:08:04.730
and as global CIO of what is $67 billion worth of money,

171
00:08:04.890 --> 00:08:07.110
where do you go private versus public?

172
00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:09.250
Where do you think the valuations are more sustainable?

173
00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:12.370
Where has the pain been felt necessarily so already?

174
00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:16.110
So first of all, everything we do is customized to clients.

175
00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:18.270
And so it has to meet their return, their risk,

176
00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:19.470
their liquidity preference.

177
00:08:19.470 --> 00:08:22.070
Because obviously, private equity and venture capital

178
00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:23.810
come with a longer term time horizon.

179
00:08:23.810 --> 00:08:26.630
So it has to be appropriate to client circumstance.

180
00:08:26.630 --> 00:08:30.610
But having said that, we do recommend for those clients

181
00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:32.670
that it's appropriate to have their foot

182
00:08:32.670 --> 00:08:34.790
in both the public and the private markets.

183
00:08:34.790 --> 00:08:37.490
Remember, the public markets today in the United States,

184
00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:40.450
30% of the index is seven companies.

185
00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:43.410
Pretty concentrated, pretty highly correlated

186
00:08:43.410 --> 00:08:45.150
to those seven stocks, et cetera.

187
00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:48.770
Although we think the other 493 represent some good value here.

188
00:08:48.770 --> 00:08:52.690
But nonetheless, you're able to play a whole host

189
00:08:52.690 --> 00:08:54.450
of different parts of the economy,

190
00:08:54.450 --> 00:08:58.470
different parts of companies, disruptive companies,

191
00:08:58.470 --> 00:08:59.410
core businesses.

192
00:08:59.410 --> 00:09:03.690
Remember, there's 40,000 so-called private companies

193
00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:04.870
in the States today.

194
00:09:05.050 --> 00:09:06.130
What do we have?

195
00:09:06.130 --> 00:09:07.770
1,500 public companies.

196
00:09:07.770 --> 00:09:09.690
So you can see you're not really accessing

197
00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:11.210
the full part of the economy.

198
00:09:11.210 --> 00:09:13.970
So again, for clients where it's appropriate,

199
00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:17.210
we do like both public and private markets.

200
00:09:17.210 --> 00:09:19.630
And we do believe that the long-term return

201
00:09:19.630 --> 00:09:22.910
from private equity, buyout, growth, and venture

202
00:09:22.910 --> 00:09:24.350
can be quite substantial.

203
00:09:24.350 --> 00:09:25.510
Do come back.

204
00:09:25.510 --> 00:09:26.890
It's been great to have you on, Nancy.

205
00:09:26.890 --> 00:09:27.930
Thank you so much.

206
00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:30.310
Nancy Curtin of LT Tiedemann Global.

207
00:09:30.310 --> 00:09:31.090
We thank her.

208
00:09:31.090 --> 00:09:33.990
Meanwhile, coming up, Elon Musk's potential AI dominance.

209
00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:35.230
We're going to stick on the AI theme

210
00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:36.450
and talk about X's grok.

211
00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:38.430
How might I overtake ChatGPT?

212
00:09:39.070 --> 00:09:39.990
This is Bloomberg Technology.
